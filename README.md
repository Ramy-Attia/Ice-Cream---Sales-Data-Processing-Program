# Ice-Cream---Sales-Data-Processing-Program
This project focuses on creating a C program to manage and process sales data for Bob's Ice Cream, which sells four flavors: vanilla, chocolate, mint, and strawberry. The sales come from two different trucks stationed at separate corners.

Features:
Enum for Flavors: An enumeration enum flavors {vanilla, chocolate, mint, strawberry}; is used to index arrays by ice cream flavors.
User Input: The program allows users to input the type of ice cream sold and sales data for each flavor.
Sales Data Storage: Sales data for each flavor is stored in two one-dimensional arrays, indexed using the enum variable.
Data Summation: The program sums the sales data for each flavor from both days (Saturday and Sunday) to calculate total sales.
Result Output: The program prints the total sales for each flavor and Bob's overall total sales for the weekend.
This repository will provide a simple and efficient solution to process and track sales data using arrays and enums in C.
